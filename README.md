# Weekend5_Challenge

## Watch a fun credit roll on the home page!

## Search the Star Wars Universe by selecting a resource and searching for an item.  Leave the search bar empty to check all items for that resource.

## Add your favorite Star Wars items to your favorites and manage them in the Favorites View.




### Installation: 
Clone repo and run npm install and open up on localhost:5000 in your browser.  

## Feature Road-map:

1.) Stop storing entire favorited object in the database.  Just store the URL and then set up calls to Swapi.co for the favorites.

2.) Use AngularMaterial for the card body on search and favorites.

3.) Play controls for the Home video screen.  Can use ng-video for that.
